  -Worked on Rock, Paper, Scissor Shoot only using javascript language that uses
  browser console. It wasn't that much of a problems
  -Did not read, again, that There has to be 5 rounds of the game and has to print
  out the result. Next time, I will fully read the instructions before starting actual
  work of the project.
  -Added appropriate increments of rounds and scores and added conditional to check if
  the round has reached its end.
